# YouTube metadata

## Channel context

Use the user's channel profile and actual source asset. For Ship Sh!t Show, read [the bundled profile](references/channel-profile.md); viewers using another channel should provide their audience, voice, formats, links and visual references. A profile is context, not permission to publish, upload footage, buy generation or contact a partner.

Identify the format, publication stage and exact asset. An upcoming live uses its source board with tentative claims; a completed stream uses its transcript; a recap or Short uses the final edit's own transcript and clock. Do not copy full-stream chapters into an edit.

Read relevant channel examples and the supplied analytics. The optional [vault analyzer](scripts/analyze-vault-performance.js) summarizes archived formats and patterns; its view counts are descriptive snapshots, not causal ranking. Use `--channel livestreams|videos|shorts|all`. Do not infer a pattern wins from an incomplete archive or unequal upload ages.

Produce a small, genuinely distinct title shortlist and a recommendation grounded in the delivered value. Keep important words legible when truncated. Avoid invented outcomes, release dates, model identities, certainty or sensational claims the video does not establish. If the source contradicts the proposed angle, explain that and offer an accurate angle.

Return a ready-to-paste description with a human opener, practical takeaways, verified chapters when relevant, source/example links and the user's channel footer. Keep speculation and time-sensitive prices attributed and dated. For published assets, check current title/link details if browsing is available; do not overwrite historical transcript claims.

Chapters must use actual edit timestamps, begin at 0:00, and satisfy YouTube's current chapter requirements. Omit uncertain chapters rather than invent them. Supply a focused comma-separated tag list plus `youtube_tags` YAML when requested. Tags primarily help spelling/ambiguity; do not promise reach from keyword stuffing.

Use [the output contract](references/output-template.md). Recommend packaging tests as hypotheses. Recheck current [YouTube title/thumbnail testing](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/16391400?hl=en) before describing availability or a winning metric. Publication and platform changes require the user's authorization.
